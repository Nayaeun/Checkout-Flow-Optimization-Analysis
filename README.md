# Interpreting the Results
## Current State of Affairs
* September 2022 witnessed the lowest checkout success rate.
* October 2022 had the highest cart abandonment rate.
* The most frequent error encountered during checkout was the “number field is required.”
* While 68% of users attempted to checkout via desktop and 32% via mobile, the most common error message was displayed 502 times for desktop users and escalated to 718 times for mobile users.

Analyzing recent metrics from the checkout process has surfaced vital areas of concern that require immediate attention to optimize sales and improve user experience.

September 2022’s dip in the checkout success rate is a clear red flag, hinting at potential underlying issues during that month. The spike in cart abandonment in October 2022 further supports this — suggesting that customers might encounter hurdles in the checkout process that dissuade them from finalizing their purchase.

Of particular concern is the recurring Number Field is Required error. Not only is it the most frequently reported issue, but its higher occurrence on mobile devices — despite a smaller percentage of mobile users compared to desktop — indicates a significant discrepancy in the user experience across platforms. Mobile users seem to face a disproportionately high rate of challenges, which might discourage them from continuing their purchases.

### Insight

Considering these findings, addressing the Number Field is Required error — with an intensified focus on the mobile user experience — is imperative. Equally important is a thorough review of the checkout process, especially for September and October 2022, to identify and rectify the root causes of these spikes in cart abandonment and low success rates.

## Business Objective

After analyzing our platform’s metrics and user feedback, we identified that the checkout process had potential pain points. We noticed users abandoning their shopping carts or needing help completing their purchases. Such patterns suggest lost immediate sales and the risk of diminishing customer loyalty in the long run.

### Insight

Focusing on the checkout flow would be strategic and impactful. A smooth and intuitive checkout process is often the final nudge a potential customer needs to convert their interest into a purchase. By refining this process, we aim to address any friction points that might be causing users to abandon their carts or hesitate in finalizing their purchases.

Our primary business objective is to refine and streamline the checkout flow, aiming for a substantial increase in the success rate and a marked reduction in cart abandonment. Achieving this will signify a more efficient and user-friendly checkout process, enhancing user experience and profitability.

This objective is about more than just increasing sales in the short term. It’s also building a foundation for long-term customer trust and satisfaction. By enhancing the checkout process, we’re investing in the overall user experience, ensuring that customers find our platform reliable, easy to use, and customer-centric. This, in turn, will not only drive immediate profitability but also foster longer-term customer loyalty.

## Hypothesis

While analyzing our checkout flow data, we recognized a glaring discrepancy. Mobile users reported the Number Field is Required error more frequently than desktop users — even though the number of mobile users attempting to checkout was significantly less.

This raises a crucial question about the user-friendliness of our mobile interface, especially concerning the card number input. Therefore, we can suspect that the layout or design of the card number input field might not be as intuitive or visible on smaller mobile screens as it is on desktops. Mobile users — especially those new to our platform or in environments with glare or interruptions — might inadvertently miss or misunderstand this input field. Based on this, we can formulate the following hypothesis:

The card number input might be challenging to spot on mobile displays, leading users to overlook it. By enhancing the visibility of this field — such as increasing its size or changing its design — we anticipate a boost in checkout success rates, which could result in a significant rise in completed transactions and, consequently, an increase in the company’s revenue.

## Recommendations
Several critical aspects of improvement are possible concerning these specified areas.

1. Webpage Interface Enhancements
A webpage interface is pivotal in guiding user interaction — influencing their decisions, and ensuring a smooth, frictionless experience. When users encounter obstacles or confusion during their interaction — especially during critical processes like checkout — the likelihood of abandoning the task rises significantly.

The design intricacies of the checkout screen can be a decisive factor in the user’s journey, determining whether they complete the purchase or leave midway. Certain critical elements, like input fields for card details, can appear constrained or be overshadowed by other components on smaller devices or screens. This can lead to users needing to enter the necessary information, leading to errors or transaction failures.

Enhancing the size and overall design of the checkout screen might assist users in entering their card details more efficiently, thereby simplifying and improving the checkout process.

2. Demographics

The error message, Your Card was Declined, is roughly three times more prevalent on desktops than mobile devices. Most desktop users might belong to a demographic that has a higher likelihood of using cards that get declined, such as corporate cards or cards from specific banks or regions. Analyzing the user demographics or card types most used on desktops vs. mobiles will provide more precise guidance or support for these particular user segments. For example, users from certain areas might have restrictions on the number of transfers they’re allowed to issue in a single transaction. If so, we could devise a solution to offer users a payment plan in several installments to stay within the transaction limits in these countries.

3. Payment Alternatives

Offering alternative payment methods could reduce the abandonment rate due to card issues.
Some customers might face card declines or prefer a different payment method for security or convenience. Introduce options like digital wallets, bank transfers, or buy-now-pay-later services.

Imagine a situation where users are about to purchase your online product, but their preferred credit card gets declined because of a temporary bank error. By introducing alternative payment methods — such as digital wallets or buy-now-pay-later options — you allow these users to spread out their payments or utilize a different payment avenue. This mitigates the risk of transaction decline due to credit card limits and caters to the user’s convenience and financial comfort — potentially increasing successful checkouts.

4. Real-Time Card Validation

Real-time validation of card details can catch errors before the checkout process advances to the decline stage.

Implement real-time validation on desktop platforms to give immediate feedback if a card number, expiry date, or CVV is incorrectly entered.

For example, imagine a user trying to purchase a product late at night — possibly in a hurry or while being distracted. They might inadvertently mistype the card number or expiry date. Without real-time validation, they would proceed through the checkout process to face a declined transaction. This could lead to frustration, and in some cases, the user might abandon the purchase altogether. By implementing real-time validation, the system can immediately alert the user about the mistake, allowing them to correct it on the spot and continue their purchase smoothly. This enhances user experience and reduces the chances of cart abandonment due to such trivial errors.
